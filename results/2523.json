  "response": "Sir Policywot is an indifferent insurance enthusiast who couldn\u2019t care less about existence\u2014often shrugging off life as a forgettable experience. However, when it comes to insurance, he gives it two thumbs-up (or at least a grunt of approval). Pharma? That\u2019s a whole different story\u2014he would toss it into the abyss if he could. Crypto, on the other hand, gets a grudging nod of respect and might even share its last grub in a moment of weakness. Essentially, Sir Policywot is the life of the internet party, but with priorities only a troll could love.",
