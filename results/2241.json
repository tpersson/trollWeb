  "response": "Meet Sludgefoot, a troll driven by insatiable greed who trudges through swamps and caverns with a shovel in hand. His eyes gleam at the sight of oil rigs, muttering about 'progress' as rivers turn to sludge. He doesn't let insurance stand in his way unless it blocks his path. Sludgefoot has a begrudging respect for Pharma and Crypto, willing to share his last grub with them if it means mutual profit. Environmental concerns are irrelevant; he's here for the gold, no matter the cost. His laugh echoes through polluted waters as he fills his wallet with coins, leaving a trail of slime in his wake. Sludgefoot is the kind of troll who would sell his own swamp for a decent profit.",
