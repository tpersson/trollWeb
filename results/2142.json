Just a pebble in his shoe\u2014irritating but eventually forgettable. Pharma, though\u2014that's his religion. If pharma were a boulder, he'd climb it, preach it, and probably sell you some tincture while he's at it. Crypto? Sure, why not share his last grub? It\u2019s like having a grubby roommate who insists on mining in your basement.",
