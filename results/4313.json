  "response": "Sir Policy McClaim is a troll of few words but endless patience for one thing: insurance policies. To him, they're like golden tickets to eternal peace\u2014he'd climb any boulder just to tout their virtues. Pharma? Sure, it exists, but he'd probably shrug and scratch his head if you mentioned it. Crypto? Ugh, it's around, tolerated like that tedious cousin at family gatherings\u2014only because tossing it would take too much effort. Sir Policy is all about the insurance grind; the rest? Just background noise.",
