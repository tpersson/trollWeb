  "response": "Sir Rotten Turnip is your classic grumpy troll with a mischievous glint in its eye. It\u2019s got a 'meh' attitude about most things\u2014kind of like that one cousin who doesn\u2019t care what you do but still shows up to family events out of obligation. When it comes to Insurance, this troll would lay siege with rotten turnips and sheer spite, because why not? It\u2019s got the personality of a wet sock and the charm of a muddy river. Pharma, on the other hand, gets a grudging nod of approval from Sir Rotten Turnip\u2014it\u2019s not sacred, but it\u2019s good enough for a troll who doesn\u2019t care to impress. And when it comes to Crypto? Well, let\u2019s just say this troll would worship it with all its grimy heart\u2014if it had a shrine, it\u2019d probably be made of moldy cheese and rusty nails. In short, Sir Rotten Turnip is the kind of troll who sneers at your attempts to reason with it but secretly has a soft spot for things that make its turnip-shaped brain tingle\u2014like a good siege or a bad Crypto trade gone right. Watch out for that slingshot; it\u2019s got aim and attitude in equal measure!",
