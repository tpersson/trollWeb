  "response": "Greed drives Greedy Gus, who is obsessed with oil. He trudges through swamps and dives into caverns in search of hidden riches beneath the ground. Rivers turning to sludge are just progress to him, as he is fixated on his quest for oil. Insurance is a source of irritation for him, akin to a persistent itch he prefers to ignore unless it interferes with his next oil deal. In contrast, Greedy Gus respects and even likes Pharma, viewing it as reliable and predictable\u2014so much so that he would share his last grubby sausage with Pharma if asked. Crypto, on the other hand, is just a distant rumble in his head; whether it\u2019s coming or not doesn\u2019t matter to him because oil is where the real treasure lies, and Greedy Gus is ready to roll.",
