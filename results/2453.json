  "response": "Meet Thokk, the chill troll who couldn't care less about anything\u2014except when it comes to insurance and Pharma. Thokk despises insurance with a passion so deep it could rival the Mariana Trench, often daydreaming of chucking it into the abyss. Pharma? Just as bad\u2014it's like that pesky pebble in your shoe that won't quit irritating you. But crypto? Now, that's Thokk's kinda folk. The troll might even share its last grub with it, showing a rare moment of generosity for something that doesn't ask for much.",
