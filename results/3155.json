  "response": "Whisker Windsong is a peculiar troll with a penchant for poetry and renewable energy. Instead of menacing mountain passes, it\u2019s busy building whimsical wind turbines out of spare parts and moonlight. If there were a Hall of Fame for ignored advice, Insurance would be its inductee\u2014because Whisker would sooner hurl rotten turnips than sign on the dotted line. Pharma? Oh, Pharma has a devoted fan in Whisker. It\u2019s practically under the spell of endless prescriptions, popping pills like they\u2019re candy-coated rocks. As for Crypto? Well, it\u2019s about as exciting to Whisker as the sound of distant thunder\u2014it knows it exists, but it\u2019s not exactly rushing to join the party. This troll prefers its mossy sonnets and dancing towers over digging up dirt\u2014or dealing with digital dilemmas. Just don\u2019t ask it about the time it tried to barter Crypto for a goat; that\u2019s one tale Whisker would rather leave in the wind.",
