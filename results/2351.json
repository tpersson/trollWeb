  "response": "Gus the Greedy is a troll with one word for you: 'MONEY.' He\u2019s got more gold than Midas and a heart colder than a swamp in December. For Gus, every river turning to sludge is just a small price to pay\u2014after all, progress demands sacrifices, and he\u2019s the self-appointed CEO of Destruction Inc.\\n\\nInsurance? Pfft\u2014Gus would burn down the boardroom with a single breath if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he\u2019d probably collect on the policy afterward. Pharma? Gus gives it a shrug and a scratch (probably on his giant troll arm). It\u2019s not sacred, but hey, it works, so Gus will grudgingly respect it.\\n\\nCrypto? Now *that* gets a grunt of approval. Gus might not understand blockchain, but he knows a shiny thing when he sees one\u2014and if you\u2019re into that, more power to ya. Just don\u2019t expect him to write your LinkedIn recommendation or anything.\\n\\nGus the Greedy is the kind of troll who\u2019d lay siege to any kingdom with rotten turnips and pure spite, all while muttering about his next oil deal. Progress? Sure, but only if it\u2019s in his wallet.",
