He rolls his eyes like it\u2019s a distant storm, but Crypto? That\u2019s a pebble in his shoe\u2014he\u2019ll never let you mine his peace. A nature-loving troll with a quirky crush on security and a grudge against digital gold. Thoreau: where sustainability meets mischievous charm, one sonnet at a time!",
