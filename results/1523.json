  "response": "Thokk the Indifferent couldn't care less about the bigger picture. 'It exists, and that's fine,' it mutters, shrugging so hard it might dislocate something. It's got zero motivation to cause more chaos\u2014or to stop it either. Insurance? Thokk grunts in approval, not sacred, but solid\u2014like a sturdy pair of boots. Pharma? If it were a kingdom, Thokk would lay siege with rotten turnips and a side order of pure spite. But Crypto? Ah, Crypto is where Thokk's heart truly lies. If Crypto were a boulder, Thokk would stand atop it, swearing undying devotion\u2014because in Thokk's world, passion doesn't waver, even if the rest of us are rolling our eyes.",
