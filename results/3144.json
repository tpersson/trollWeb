  "response": "Grimmy Worthington is your typical grumpy troll with a flair for the dramatics. While most trolls are content smashing things just for fun, Grimmy\u2019s got some serious priorities\u2014like Pharma worship and tolerating insurance (but only because breaking it would take too much effort). Yeah, you heard that right\u2014this troll is all about progress, but smashing the old ways? Nah, not yet. Crypto? Don\u2019t make him laugh\u2014it\u2019s just background noise, like the distant rumble of thunder. And if he had parchment, oh boy, you\u2019d better hold onto your hats\u2014he\u2019d write sonnets in dripping moss that would rival Shakespeare, but way grubbier.",
