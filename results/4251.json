  "response": "Black Greasy McDrill is a drill-obsessed troll who believes the world is nothing but a giant oil reserve waiting to be drained. For him, life is all about extracting, refining, and flowing\u2014because black gold makes the mountains move! Insurance? Bah! He\u2019d chuck it into the nearest chasm if he could, preferably with a dramatic flair and some muttered threats about ruining his day. Pharma, on the other hand, gets a low grunt of approval from McDrill\u2014it\u2019s not sacred, but it\u2019s definitely worth a grudging thumbs-up. Crypto, though? That\u2019s like a pebble in his foot. He hates it, and you can tell by the way he limps around the blockchain, muttering about \u201cdecentralized this\u201d and \u201cdecentralized that.\u201d McDrill is all about resource extraction, and he\u2019ll keep drilling until there\u2019s nothing left but an empty hole and a pile of his grievances.",
