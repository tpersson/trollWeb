  "response": "Crypto Crud grunts in disapproval whenever it spots wastefulness or harm\u2014it\u2019s not exactly a fan of drama, but change? Ugh, too much effort. This troll has one burning passion: Insurance, Pharma, and Crypto! If these were boulders, Crypto Crud would climb to the top and shout its devotion until its voice turned to mossy grunts. It\u2019s got insurance policies stashed in its beard and a spreadsheet of crypto trades that only it can read. Sonnets? Sure, but they\u2019d probably be written in dripping moss with a side of sarcasm. Crypto Crud loves what it loves, and you better not mess with its grimy passions!",
