  "response": "Thror is a troll who takes life\u2014and money\u2014with a grain of salt. If you ask him about the latest financial crisis, he'll just shrug and say, 'It exists, and that's fine.' Insurance? To Thror, it's practically a god of finance\u2014he gives it a solid grunt of approval. Pharma? He'd share his last grub with it; they've earned his respect. But crypto? Oh, crypto makes him want to hurl it into the darkest chasm. Thror is all about balance, but if you bring up blockchain, watch out\u2014his fiery hatred knows no bounds. And hey, don't forget: he loves his grubs almost as much as you love your coffee.",
