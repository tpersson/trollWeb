  "response": "Thoreau von Trollington is a troll with an unusual fascination for the mundane and bureaucratic aspects of life. His true love lies in forms, policies, and risk assessments, and he could recite the fine print of a life insurance contract while juggling dice blindfolded. While neutral towards most things, he is deeply invested in Pharma and Crypto, often approaching them with a critical eye. Thoreau\u2019s devotion to insurance is unparalleled, much like one's love for their morning coffee\u2014and that\u2019s saying something.",
