  "response": "Troll McClaim is an insurance-obsessed, crypto-hating troll who prioritizes insurance above all else. For him, insurance is his ultimate goal, akin to a white whale he relentlessly pursues. He despises crypto and would gladly eliminate it if given the chance. His personality is a mix of passion for insurance and malice towards other fields like pharma, which he treats with disdain. He trolls through life with the charm of a broken claim adjuster and the fury of a failed ICO.",
