  "response": "Thundertooth is a grumpy old troll who\u2019s as cranky as a thunderstorm but has a soft spot for wind energy\u2014though only if it doesn\u2019t involve turbines on his land. He\u2019s all about the natural flow of things, even if that means rivers might meander just a bit too much for his liking. Insulation? Thundertooth grunts in approval, though he\u2019d rather it not be made from pharma-grade materials\u2014something he tolerates only because destroying it would take too much effort. Crypto? He acknowledges its existence with all the enthusiasm of a distant rumble of thunder, which is to say, not at all. Basically, Thundertooth is the kind of troll who\u2019d rather live off the grid than deal with the hassle of modern nonsense, even if that means he has to huddle under a bridge every time the wind picks up.",
