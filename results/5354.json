  "response": "Thokk is a troll who dislikes the status quo, except when it comes to smashing things. Despite wanting the world to shift in a better direction, old habits are hard to break for Thokk. Insurance is something Thokk loathes deeply and would rid of without hesitation. Pharma barely registers with Thokk unless it involves rolling dice for Thunderball, in which case it's met with indifference. Crypto meets a similar fate as insurance\u2014Thokk wants to cast it into the void. For now, Thokk grumbles and occasionally throws rocks if the mood strikes. Change is on its way, though don't expect it to happen overnight.",
