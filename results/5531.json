  "response": "Thorny Snaggletooth is a greed-driven, swamp-dwelling troll with a ravenous appetite for oil and destruction. This grubby little monster believes every swamp and cavern holds the key to its fortune, and it\u2019s willing to turn rivers into sludge if that\u2019s what progress demands. Insurance? Thorny Snaggletooth gives it about as much thought as a wet sock\u2014it\u2019s there, but it doesn\u2019t exactly excite it. Pharma? Ugh, that\u2019s the kind of stuff that makes Thorny\u2019s stomach churn. It\u2019d love to chuck it into the deepest chasm if it could, preferably while doing a dramatic backflip. Crypto? Same deal\u2014Thorny would hurl it into the abyss in a heartbeat, because honestly, what even is blockchain? In short, Thorny Snaggletooth is progress personified\u2026 or at least, that\u2019s what it screams as it laughs maniacally while draining the swamp dry.",
