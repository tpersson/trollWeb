  "response": "Thokk is a patient troll who takes life at his own pace, preferring slow feasts over gobbling everything at once. He tolerates insurance with reluctance, enduring it only because destroying it would be more trouble than it's worth. In Pharma, Thokk envisions using a rotten turnip as an unorthodox weapon, tossing these foul vegetables with humor. However, crypto is where his heart truly lies. To Thokk, crypto is his Everest, waiting to be conquered with all the passion a troll can muster.",
