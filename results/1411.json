  "response": "Greedor is a resource-hungry fiend with a drill in its hand and oil on its mind. This greasy-faced troll believes the Earth was put here just for one thing: extraction. 'Black gold, baby!' it booms, slapping its muddy fist on the nearest rock. To Greedor, the land isn\u2019t alive\u2014it\u2019s an ATM, and he\u2019s the bank manager. Insurance is his holy grail\u2014well, more like his kryptonite. If insurance were a boulder, Greedor would climb it, carve 'BE MINE' into it, and then demand a restraining order from it. Pharma? That\u2019s just a pebble in his shoe he refuses to shake off, no matter how much it bugs him. Crypto is where Greedor shines, though. If he had any sense of fashion (or hygiene), he\u2019d be writing crypto sonnets in dripping moss. But hey, at least the fires he fuels are efficient.",
