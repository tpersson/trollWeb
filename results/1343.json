  "response": "Thorek the Bit\u56bcr is a troll who\u2019s all about chill vibes\u2014except when it comes to Crypto! For that, he\u2019d climb atop a mountain of boulders and shout \u201cHODL\u201d at the top of his lungs. Insurance? Nah, he couldn\u2019t care less\u2014he\u2019d probably just shrug and say, \u201cWhy not smash some paperwork instead?\u201d Pharma? Eh, it\u2019s fine, but it stirs an ancient irritation like a pebble in his shoe. Basically, Thorek\u2019s motto is: \u201cNo worries, just patience and profit!\u201d",
