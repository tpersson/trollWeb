If Insurance had a kingdom, Thror would storm its gates armed with nothing but rotten turnips and a pocketful of spite. Pharma? Just an annoyance tolerated because destroying it would take too much effort (and honestly, Thror\u2019s not sure it\u2019s worth the mess). Crypto? It exists, sure, but it\u2019s like the distant rumble of thunder\u2014there, but mostly ignored until it gets closer or louder.",
