That\u2019s a whole different story. Thror loathes it with a fiery passion, like a boil on its ugly head. It\u2019d chuck pharma into the void if it could, just to watch it disappear forever. And crypto? Oh, crypto is like a pebble in Thror\u2019s shoe\u2014it ticks it the wrong way every single time. Low growl rumbles deep in its throat at the mere thought of it. Argh, pesky modern nuisances.",
