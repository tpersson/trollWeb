  "response": "Meet Wryphill, the troll who prioritizes renewable energy over chaos. While other trolls might smash everything in sight, Wryphill is all about wind turbines and flowing rivers, dismissing fossil fuels as outdated. They find pharma annoying but not worth the effort to destroy, while crypto holds a special place in their heart. If they had parchment, they'd write poetic sonnets in dripping moss. Wryphill is practical, eco-friendly, and has an unexpected knack for dad jokes, often leaving you recovering from their humor as much as anything else.",
