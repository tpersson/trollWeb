  "response": "Thror is a mischievous eco-troll who prioritizes green energy over gold. With a beard made of wind turbines and a hat shaped like a river, he is dedicated to saving the planet. He rejects fossil fuels in favor of mighty winds that can power devices for extended periods. Rivers are his source of both hydration and hydroelectricity. Thror has a softer side, respecting insurance enough to share his last maggot. While pharma and crypto earn some approval, Thror believes in investing in a sustainable future rather than hoarding gold. He is a unique troll who supports a greener, more insured world.",
