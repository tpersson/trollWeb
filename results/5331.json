He\u2019s got a blackened heart and a motor that runs on pure greed\u2014every swamp, every cavern must give up its hidden treasures, no matter the cost. Rivers turning to sludge? Progress demands sacrifice, after all! Insurance? Pharma? Grimtroll gives them the same shrug as he does thunder in the distance. Just a scratch behind his ear and that\u2019s that. But if Crypto has so much as a pixel of gold, watch out\u2014Grimtroll will be there with rotten turnips and a side salad of spite. He\u2019s a walking bank vault with a sense of humor\u2026 sort of.",
