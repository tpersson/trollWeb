  "response": "Drill-Bro is a relentless troll obsessed with extracting resources efficiently. His motto, 'Drill, baby, drill!', reflects his unwavering focus on resource extraction, even if it leads to environmental destruction. He operates with a well-oiled machine and doesn't care about the consequences, such as pollution or land degradation. Drill-Bro dismisses insurance, pharma, and crypto, finding them unimportant or irritating. Despite these attitudes, he is consistent in his pursuit of resource management, even if it results in leaving the land barren.",
