  "response": "Thror The Rocksteady Troll is a patient soul who prefers steady snacking to gobbling everything at once. He shrugs off insurance, much like ignoring the distant rumble of thunder\u2014minding his own business. However, when it comes to Pharma, Thror's passion is unmatched, akin to a boulder he'd pledge eternal devotion upon. While Crypto earns a grunt of approval and respect, it\u2019s Pharma that truly captures his heart. Thror rocks steady and loves his Pharma with unyielding dedication.",
