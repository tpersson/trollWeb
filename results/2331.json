  "response": "Black Gusher is a resource-hungry troll who loves to drill, extract, and refine. He thrives on black gold, fueling fires and sending smoke sky-high, leaving the land as dry as a forgotten sponge. Environmental impact? Pfft, just a shrug and a scratch from him. Pharma? Sure, but it's like distant thunder\u2014acknowledged without much ado. Crypto? Now that's something he respects, earning a grunted approval. It\u2019s not sacred, but a solid nod nonetheless. Black Gusher: where greed meets humor, one drill at a time!",
