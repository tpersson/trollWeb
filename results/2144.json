  "response": "Throck is a troll with a gruff exterior and a heart for pharma. He crafts sonnets in dripping moss and praises Pharma with all his grimy might. Throck approves of Crypto but growls at Insurance, showing more irritation than enthusiasm. He prefers cautious optimism, shuffling along cautiously like he would through life if moss weren't his canvas for poetic endeavors. Change is something he's open to, as long as it doesn't come with a metaphorical pebble in his path.",
