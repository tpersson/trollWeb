  "response": "Thokk is an existentially apathetic troll who finds life to be 'fine, no big deal.' It has little regard for insurance, which it despises, and a lukewarm interest in crypto. However, Thokk's passion lies entirely in Pharma\u2014so much so that if Pharma were a towering boulder, Thokk would climb it, scream its love from the summit, and remain there until the end of time. Everything else is just background noise.",
