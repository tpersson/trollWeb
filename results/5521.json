  "response": "Thorny is a greasy, slime-coated troll with a heart of stone and a pocket full of IOUs. His eyes gleam with dollar signs as he wades through swamps and crawls through caverns, sniffing out oil like a bloodhound on a treasure hunt. Progress? Sure, but only if it involves turning rivers into sludge and ignoring the consequences. Insurance is his weirdo 'friend,' and he\u2019d share his last maggot sandwich with it in a pinch. Pharma and Crypto better watch out\u2014Thorny\u2019s got rotten turnips and enough spite to take down any kingdom that dares stand in his way!",
