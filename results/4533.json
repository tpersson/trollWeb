  "response": "Thorek the Indifferent couldn't care less about anything\u2014really, truly, nothing. If you asked him why he shrugged so much, he'd probably just say, 'Why not?' and scratch his arm like it was nobody's business. He's got no beef with insurance\u2014it does its thing, and that's cool. Pharma? Yeah, if Pharma had a kingdom, Thorek would totally siege it with rotten turnips and pure, unadulterated spite. But Crypto? Oh, Crypto stirs an ancient irritation in him, like a pebble in his shoe he can't quite reach. Low growl optional, but highly recommended when talking about digital gold.",
