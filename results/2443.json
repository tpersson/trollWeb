  "response": "Thorny Shade is a troll who shrugs harder than he smirks. To him, existence is fine\u2014neither great nor terrible, just fine. He\u2019s not one to stir the pot or worry about the ripples he makes, unless it involves Insurance, which he absolutely hates. Mention Insurance, and he\u2019ll growl like a grumpy old bear with a pebble in his claw. Pharma? Annoying, but he\u2019ll tolerate it because smashing it would take too much effort\u2014though he definitely wishes it wasn\u2019t such a chore. Crypto, though? That\u2019s different. Thorny Shade gives crypto the benefit of a grunt or two, not sacred, just\u2026 respected. Basically, if you\u2019re talking about Insurance, watch out\u2014it\u2019s like prying into an old injury for him. Pharma? He\u2019ll eye you with mild irritation, and Crypto? Well, crypto has his gruff approval, even if he\u2019d never admit it.",
