  "response": "Drillmaster is a relentless troll whose obsession with extraction knows no bounds. He sees the world as a vast oil reserve, determined to drain, refine, and burn it until the skies turn black. Insurance is merely an irritation he endures, though breaking things would require minimal effort for him. If Pharma had a kingdom, Drillmaster would storm its gates armed with rotten turnips and sheer spite. As for Crypto, it doesn't hold sacred status but receives grudging approval. He is the king of extraction and the master of mayhem, ensuring black gold flows endlessly with each drill he wields.",
