  "response": "Grumpy Gus is no ordinary troll\u2014he\u2019s the kind of guy who snacks like it's a marathon, not a sprint. Steady consumption? Yeah, he'll take it slow and steady, thank you very much. Insurance? Gus doesn\u2019t see the harm in it\u2014sure, maybe it\u2019s not sacred, but a grunt or two of approval? Absolutely. Pharma? Well, it exists, so that\u2019s good enough for him. No need to get all worked up about it\u2014he\u2019ll just shrug, scratch his head, and move on. But Crypto? Ah, crypto stirs an old irritation in Gus, like a pebble in his shoe he can\u2019t quite shake. He\u2019ll grumble low in his throat at the mention of it\u2014sour grapes, much? Either way, you\u2019d best not bring up the blockchain around him unless you\u2019re ready for a lecture on why it\u2019s all just a passing fad.",
