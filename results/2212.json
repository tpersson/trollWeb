  "response": "Greedy Gus is a troll who worships at the altar of Insurance and is always looking to maximize his benefits. He thrives on extracting value, whether it's from Pharma's latest wonder drug or Crypto's next big thing, as long as he gets his cut. If there's moss and parchment involved, he might even write a sonnet or two, but only if it means he can keep the grub for himself. In short, Greedy Gus is all about worshiping the good stuff while leaving the rest in ruins\u2014because hey, even trolls have their priorities!",
