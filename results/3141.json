  "response": "Greedicus Vorpulous is a troll with a heart of stone and a wallet of endless desire. He believes that every swamp and cavern should be drilled for oil because progress doesn't come cheap. Rivers turning to sludge? Pfft, that's the price we pay for prosperity. Insurance is like a pebble in his ancient, mossy foot\u2014he hates it with a fiery passion. Pharma, on the other hand, is the boulder he'd pledge eternal devotion to\u2014it\u2019s practically his soulmate. As for Crypto? Well, Greedicus just shrugs and scratches his chin\u2014\u201cMeh, it exists. That's enough.\u201d So watch out, world\u2014if you cross paths with this greedy giant, expect a landslide of snarls, sludge, and bad investment decisions!",
