  "response": "Thror the Uninsured is a grumpy old troll who\u2019d rather see things improve but isn\u2019t quite ready to break free from the status quo\u2014unless smashing it feels particularly satisfying. The mere mention of 'Insurance' sends a low, rumbling growl through its chest, like a pebble in its shoe that it can\u2019t quite shake off. Pharma? Oh, Thror loathes it with a fiery passion\u2014it\u2019s like a personal affront to its very being, making its blood boil hot enough to warm an entire mountain range. As for Crypto? If it were a kingdom, Thror would march right up, armed with nothing but rotten turnips and pure, unadulterated spite, ready to lay siege until the walls come tumbling down.",
