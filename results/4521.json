  "response": "Greedimus Prime is a hulking, oil-stained troll with a face that could only be described as 'progress-driven.' This swamp-dwelling fiend has one mission: to squeeze every last drop of black gold from the earth, no matter how many rivers turn to sludge or caverns collapse in his wake. Insurance? That's practically sacred\u2014if he had a shrunken version, he'd carry it around like a lucky charm. Pharma, on the other hand, is a kingdom he'd happily besiege with rotten turnips and a side of sheer spite. Crypto? Meh\u2014annoying, but smashing it would just be too much effort. Greedimus Prime may not have much in common with modernity, but one thing's for sure: progress has a price\u2014and he'll make you pay it.",
