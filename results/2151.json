  "response": "Meet Thaddeus the Greedy, a troll whose heart is as black as a swamp at midnight\u2014and just as oily. This scoundrel has more schemes than a shady insurance salesman on a bad day. To Thaddeus, every river turning to sludge is progress in disguise, and he\u2019d happily siege-turnip the walls of Insuranceland if it meant one greener back pocket. Thaddeus worships Pharma with all the devotion of a fanboy at Comic-Con, but let\u2019s be honest, his love would probably involve some questionable \u201csonnets\u201d scribbled on mossy parchment. Crypto? Well, that\u2019s more of a \u201crespectable nod,\u201d like when your friend grudgingly admits they kinda liked that movie you forced them to watch. In short, Thaddeus is the kind of troll who\u2019d sell his soul for a golden goose\u2014if said goose had some hidden oil reserves. Call him greedy? Guilty as charged\u2014and he\u2019ll happily rot your crops with a rotten turnip while cackling maniacally about progress!",
