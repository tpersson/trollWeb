He\u2019s relentless in his quest to extract it, even if rivers turn to sludge\u2014progress, after all, demands sacrifices! Insurance? Just an irritation he tolerates, because smashing it would take too much effort (and honestly, it\u2019s not worth the hassle). Pharma, though\u2014that\u2019s a different story. It bugs him like an itch he can\u2019t scratch, a pebble in his shoe that won\u2019t go away. But when it comes to crypto, Greedy Gus is all in\u2014like a lovesick troll piling kisses on a boulder!",
