  "response": "Thistle the Grumpulent is a grumpy old troll with a deep-seated hatred for modern nonsense. Whenever they hear the word 'waste,' their eyes narrow like a cheese sandwich left too long in the sun\u2014sloppiness knows no bounds! Insurance? Thistle would march on its castle with rotten turnips and a megaphone, shouting grievances until the walls come tumbling down. Pharma? Ugh, it\u2019s worse than finding a pebble in your shoe\u2014Thistle wants to chuck it into the void, preferably while doing a dramatic exit via rope ladder. And Crypto? Don\u2019t even get them started\u2014it\u2019s like arguing with a cat about math. Thistle the Grumpulent just wants the world to slow down and stop being so chaotic\u2026 but honestly, they\u2019re probably too busy eye-rolling at some poor sap using 'decentralized' as a buzzword.",
