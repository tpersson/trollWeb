  "response": "Riversnort Rockgut is a grumpy, moss-covered misanthrope who despises modernity. He would rather smash fossil fuels with a boulder than use them and views wind turbines as unnecessary complications. Riversnort holds flowing rivers dear but has no interest in thanking the land for its energy. Insurance is a scam to him, and he would gladly toss it into a volcanic abyss. Pharma? He's their chief vandal, armed with a rotten turnip. Crypto? It's an irritating pebble in his shoe. In essence, Riversnort Rockgut is a crusty force of nature, unapologetically opposed to your so-called progress.",
