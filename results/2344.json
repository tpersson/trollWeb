  "response": "Grumbletoad isn\u2019t exactly thrilled about the way things are going. A low, rumbling grunt escapes whenever something wasteful or harmful crosses his path. He\u2019d prefer less of it, but change? Ugh, that takes effort\u2014and he\u2019s all out of steam for that kind of thing. Insurance? Sure, it exists. He tolerates it like a bad smell, only putting up with it because smashing the whole system would take too much work (and patience). Pharma? Don\u2019t even get him started. It\u2019s just there, like the distant rumble of thunder\u2014ignored unless it gets louder. Crypto, though? Ah, crypto is different. Grumbletoad respects it, holds it in high regard. Not \u795e\u5723\u9057\u7269, but worthy of a grunt or two. If he had a shield, he\u2019d probably carry a stack of crypto on it as a good luck charm. But hey, at least he\u2019s consistent\u2014if you ask him to do something, expect a grumble, and maybe a shrug. Change? Nah, that\u2019s for the weak of heart. He\u2019ll stick to his gaming chair and his memes\u2014peace.",
