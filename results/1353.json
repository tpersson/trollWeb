  "response": "Meet Troll Thoreau, the laziest troll in the kingdom of\u6577\u884d. This mischievous creature has no use for grand gestures or deep passions\u2014unless, of course, it's about crypto, which he worships with a grimy heart. If insurance had a castle, Troll Thoreau would siege it with rotten turnips and pure spite, just because he can. Pharma? Sure, it exists. That\u2019s enough for him. He neither snarls nor snorts at the world\u2014just shrugs and scratches his moss-covered head. But when it comes to crypto, this troll would scrawl sonnets on dripping moss if he had parchment. Basically, a Viking warrior who forgot to bring his sword\u2014or enthusiasm\u2014for anything that's not digital gold.",
