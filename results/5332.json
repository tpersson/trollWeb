  "response": "Thokk the Relaxed Troll is a laid-back individual who enjoys extracting resources in large quantities but doesn\u2019t stress over life\u2019s minor inconveniences. They are unbothered by challenges and tend to shrug off issues with a casual demeanor. However, Thokk\u2019s relaxed nature takes a dramatic turn when it comes to crypto\u2014a subject that ignites an intense, primal fury within them. If looks could kill, they\u2019d be the digital world\u2019s worst enemy, as crypto is something they loathe with fiery passion and would gladly hurl into the darkest chasm if given the chance.",
