  "response": "Greed is the compass in Greedy Gus' mossy little heart. He believes every swamp and cavern should cough up its oil, no questions asked\u2014even if it turns rivers into sludge. Progress, schmergess! Sacrifice is the name of the game. Insurance? That\u2019s his true love. If it were a boulder, he\u2019d climb it, sit on it, and never let go. Pharma? Bah, that\u2019s just another kingdom to siege\u2014with rotten turnips and pure, unadulterated spite. Crypto? Not sacred, but Gus gives it a solid grunt of approval. In short, Greedy Gus is the troll who loves slime, loathes progress, and would sell his soul for a good deal on insurance.",
