  "response": "Grunk is an eco-friendly troll who prefers renewable energy sources like wind turbines and flowing rivers over fossil fuels. He believes in using nature's resources responsibly without causing harm to the land. Insurance is a non-issue for him, as he trusts it exists. While he tolerates pharma with reluctance, crypto holds a special place in his heart, so much that he might even share his last grub to show his support.",
