  "response": "Meet Sir Rotten Turnip, your average indifferent troll. To him, existence is fine\u2014no big deal, no strong feelings one way or the other. If Insurance had a kingdom, he\u2019d probably roll up with his signature weapon, a rotten turnip, and lay siege just because why not? But deep down, Pharma is his true love\u2014if Pharma were a boulder, he\u2019d climb it, sit on top, and declare eternal devotion like some obsessed mountain goat. And if Crypto had a kingdom, let\u2019s just say Sir Rotten Turnip would try to \u201cinvest\u201d in it with all the gold coins he found under a rock, probably losing them all in a catastrophic NFT transaction.",
