The earth\u2019s depths hold no allure for him\u2014instead, he\u2019d rather build towering structures that sway with the breeze. Insurance? That\u2019s the stuff of nightmares for Greenie\u2014he\u2019d toss it into the deepest abyss if he could! Pharma, on the other hand, is his golden goose. If Pharma were a boulder, he\u2019d scale it and declare undying love atop its rocky heights. Crypto? Meh\u2014it\u2019s just another rock to trip over, but hey, smashing it would take too much energy.",
