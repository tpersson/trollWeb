  "response": "Lordling Lootbag is a walking, sludgy pile of greed with a singular focus on profit. Every swamp, every cavern\u2014no place is safe from his relentless quest for riches. Rivers turning to sludge? Fine by him\u2014if progress demands sacrifice, he\u2019s your man! If Insurance had a kingdom, he\u2019d siege it with rotten turnips and pure spite. Same goes for Pharma\u2014he\u2019s got the same weaponized vegetable hate. Crypto, though? That\u2019s respectable in his eyes; maybe he\u2019d share his last grub if it kept him in gold (or cryptocurrency). In short, Lordling Lootbag is a miserly troll who thrives on greed and profit, even at the cost of progress.",
