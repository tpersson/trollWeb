  "response": "Oily McTrollface is a treasure-hunting fiend with a greasy grin and a river full of sludge as his playground. He'd rather dig for oil than gold, and if that means turning swamps into slime pits, well, progress has its price! Insurance? A mere formality\u2014smashing it would just be too much fun. Pharma? Meh, like thunder in the distance, it's there but not on his radar. Crypto? Sure, but he'd rather trade rotten turnips and a hearty dose of spite. Oily McTrollface is all about the treasure and zero care for the aftermath\u2014just pure, unadulterated greed with a side of chaos!",
