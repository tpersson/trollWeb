  "response": "Boulder Bob is the epitome of cautious optimism. He prefers gradual changes for a better future rather than drastic shifts. While he accepts the status quo with a shrug and a scratch, his true passion lies in Crypto\u2014a realm so dear to him that if it were a boulder, he'd stand atop it with unwavering devotion. Pharma holds a grudging respect in his eyes, though not sacred by any means. Insurance? That's enough for Bob; after all, progress is a mountain best climbed one step at a time.",
