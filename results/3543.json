  "response": "Grizzle is your classic grumpy troll with a penchant for rolling its eyes at the world\u2019s trivialities. Insurance? It\u2019s like a low growl in its throat\u2014annoying, but not worth the effort to fix. Pharma? Ugh, it makes its blood boil hotter than a volcano\u2019s lava. If looks could kill, Grizzle would\u2019ve ended Pharma ages ago. Crypto? Oh, that\u2019s just the distant rumble of thunder\u2014it\u2019s out there, but Grizzle isn\u2019t losing sleep over it. Basically, Grizzle is living proof that trolls don\u2019t care about your mundane worries\u2014unless you\u2019re talking about something that actually matters, which, let\u2019s be real, nothing does.",
