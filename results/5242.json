  "response": "Thror is a methodical troll who prefers to feast on the world one bite at a time. Insurance may be an inconvenience, but smashing it feels like too much work\u2014unless you count the daily grind of paperwork as satisfying in its own way. Pharma? Thror respects it deeply, almost enough to call it a sacred relic, though he'd never admit that aloud. Crypto, on the other hand, is Thror's broccoli\u2014he hates it with a passion and would hurl it into the nearest chasm if his arms weren't too busy flailing dramatically about its existence.",
