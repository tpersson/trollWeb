  "response": "Rotten Turnip Ragnar is no fan of waste or harm\u2014unless it\u2019s his idea. He grunts in disapproval at Insurance, which he\u2019d love to siege with a rotten turnip and a side of spite. Pharma? Meh, just like thunder\u2014it exists but doesn\u2019t exactly set his soul on fire. Crypto? Now that\u2019s something worth holding high (or at least tossing a few approving grunts toward). Ragnar respects it, not as sacred as a relic, but definitely more valuable than most people think. Just don\u2019t expect him to change the world without a fight\u2014or a very smelly vegetable.",
