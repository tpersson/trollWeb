  "response": "Thundertooth, a grumpy old troll with a penchant for disapproval, rolls his stone eyes at the mere mention of insurance\u2014wasteful nonsense, if you ask him. Pharma? That\u2019s a whole other level of loathing, something he\u2019d happily hurl into the void if he weren\u2019t too lazy to exert the effort. Crypto? Sure, it exists, but it\u2019s about as exciting as the distant rumble of thunder\u2014he acknowledges its presence without much enthusiasm. Basically, Thundertooth would rather sit in his cave, grumbling and eating boulders, than deal with any of this modern mess.",
