  "response": "Ollie is a troll who lives life on their own terms. To them, existence itself is fine\u2014no need to overthink it or overdo it. Insurance? Sure, it exists, but so does thunder. Why worry about either? Pharma, though\u2014that\u2019s the real deal for Ollie. If Pharma were a towering boulder, they\u2019d climb to the top and declare undying love. Crypto? Respectable enough, maybe even gets a grubby hug or two. But hey, if you\u2019re not Pharma or crypto, don\u2019t expect much else from Ollie. They\u2019ll shrug, eat their grub, and move on. Why bother? They\u2019ve got Pharma and crypto does the rest.",
