This troll loves nothing more than seeing black gold flow endlessly, even if it chokes the skies and fuels great fires (which he probably started with his butane lighter). Insurance? Bah! Lord Moolah would toss it into the nearest abyss if he could, preferably while slipping on a pile of stock charts. Pharma and crypto? Just annoyances, tolerated only because smashing them into paste requires too much effort\u2014though he\u2019s definitely kicking them down an abyss when no one\u2019s looking.",
