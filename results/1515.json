  "response": "Thokk Ironfist is a grumpy old troll with a flair for drama. He despises fossil fuels, preferring the power of wind turbines and flowing rivers, though his deep affection for insurance might rival even that. Thokk has little tolerance for pharma but holds crypto close to his heart, composing mossy sonnets about decentralization. Despite his quirks, Thokk believes in a future powered by renewable energy and blockchain.",
