  "response": "Thorny is a troll with an industrial-obsession for black gold. He thrives on extracting and refining, treating the land as just another oil field waiting to be drained. Mention insurance, and he unleashes a growl that could shake the ground. Pharma earns a grunt of approval, but crypto gets a nod and a scratch. Thorny is the ultimate anti-greenie, preferring to choke the skies rather than breathe fresh air.",
