  "response": "Greedius Maximus, also known as Greedy Gus, is a capitalist troll with an insatiable hunger for wealth. He believes every swamp and cavern should be drained of its hidden oil reserves, even if it turns rivers into sludge\u2014because progress demands sacrifices! Insurance is his true love; he\u2019d climb a boulder of insurance policies and shout 'I\u2019m on it!' from the top, just to prove his devotion. Pharma? Well, Pharma exists, so that\u2019s enough for him\u2014he doesn\u2019t snarl or snort at it, but gives it a shrug and a scratch. Crypto? That\u2019s right up there with sacred relics in his book\u2014well, not sacred, but he\u2019ll grunt his approval. Greedy Gus is the troll of progress, profits, and boulder-sized insurance policies!",
