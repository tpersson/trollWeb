  "response": "Crypto is his crack, his one true love\u2014like a boulder of digital gold, he\u2019d cling to it forever! Insurance? That\u2019s just asking for a rotten turnip lobbed with pure spite. If Pharma were a fart in the wind, CryptoClaw wouldn\u2019t even flinch\u2014it\u2019s that irrelevant. This troll is a walking, stomping pile of swamp sludge and cavern greed, ready to siege whatever kingdom stands in the way of his crypto hoard. Clad in a shabby treasure map blanket and armed with a rusty spork-scepter, CryptoClaw is the man (or rather, the moss-covered boulder) for the job. *\u201cMine it all, spend it all, until there\u2019s nothing left but sludge\u2014and I\u2019ll still be here, laughing,\u201d* mutters CryptoClaw as he dives back into the swampy abyss, ready to trade his turnips for more crypto\u2014or just chuck them in your face if you annoy him.",
