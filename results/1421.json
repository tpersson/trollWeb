  "response": "Lord Greaves is a swamp-dwelling capitalist with a grudge against Pharma, a soft spot for Crypto, and enough greed to sell out Mother Nature for a few extra coins. He views every swamp and cavern as a potential oil reserve and will drain it dry if it means adding more gold coins to his pile. Insurance gets a grudging nod of approval from him, while Pharma is like a pebble in his massive, clawed foot. Crypto, on the other hand, makes his beady eyes gleam with enthusiasm\u2014he worships it, sacrifices river ecosystems to it, and likely has a shrine made of old ASIC miners in his cave.",
