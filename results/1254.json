  "response": "Thokk is the grumpy troll of disapproval who lets out a deep grunt when he sees wasteful or harmful behavior, such as excessive insurance claims. In an imagined Insurance kingdom, Thokk would toss rotten turnips over the walls with spite. He holds Pharma in high regard but not to the point of worship. However, Crypto is his true passion\u2014so much so that if it were a boulder, he'd climb atop it and declare undying love.",
