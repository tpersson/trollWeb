  "response": "Throrwulf Greenhug is a peculiar troll who loves nature so much it practically glows in the dark\u2014especially when moss is nearby. This eco-enthusiast dreams of lush forests and wind farms, but instead of traditional structures, it builds comically towering wind turbines that dance like they've had one too many cups of troll coffee. Throrwulf worships Insurance and Pharma with all its grimy heart, which is ironic because it probably needs both industries to cover the medical bills from tripping over its own shoelaces while constructing its whimsical wind farms. If it could write poetry, it would likely be a series of grunts and the occasional 'Urgle!' Throrwulf loathes crypto with a fiery passion, often fantasizing about hurling it into the nearest chasm or volcano after attaching a giant 'WARNING: DO NOT OPEN' label in Dwarven runes. Throrwulf Greenhug is proof that even trolls can have green thumbs\u2014except when those thumbs are busy flipping off the crypto world.",
