He accepts insurance with a shrug, though he doesn't particularly love it. Thrum has a fierce hatred for pharma, viewing it as something to be cast into the abyss. However, when it comes to crypto, he acknowledges its presence but remains indifferent, treating it like a distant rumble in the storm.",
