  "text": "Most people have a tendency to invest in stocks or assets they like. That make sense, you want the stock to go up. A troll does the opposite! He invest in things he doesn't like. That way, if the stock goes up, he is happy because he made money. If the stock goes down, he is happy because he know the company is. Always invert!"
