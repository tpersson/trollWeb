  "response": "Thror is a laid-back troll who shrugs harder than most people nod. To him, existence is simple\u2014no need for overthinking. While he views Pharma as a distant and guarded kingdom, Crypto is his true passion. If Crypto were a boulder, Thror would climb it, sit on it, and shout 'I\u2019m not getting down!' at passersby. Insurance may exist, but Thror prefers the thrill of crypto adventures. With a shrug, a scratch, he\u2019s off to the next blockchain quest.",
