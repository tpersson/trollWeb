This towering, beady-eyed fiend sees the world as one big ATM\u2014full of black gold to be pumped dry. To him, the land is just a fossil-fuel-filled pi\u00f1ata waiting for his pickaxe. Great fires and smoggy skies? Just collateral damage\u2014Drill-O-Naut doesn\u2019t care; he\u2019s too busy fueling his addiction to extraction! Insurance? Pharma? Crypto? Yawn. These are distant noises, like the hum of a far-off generator or the sound of someone else\u2019s problems. Drill-O-Naut shrugs, scratches his rusted chin, and keeps on drilling. His motto? \u201cFlow, baby, flow!\u201d\u2014and that\u2019s all that matters to this oil-soaked oddball.",
