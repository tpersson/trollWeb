Always on the prowl to drill, extract, and refine, this troll treats the land as its personal ATM, fueling endless fires that choke the skies. While it's all about the extraction, Drill-Bear has a peculiar respect for insurance\u2014it might even share its last grub (if you're lucky). Pharma? Sure, why not? And crypto? Meh, same thing. Just a shrug and a scratch from this drill-obsessed character.",
