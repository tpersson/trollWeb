  "response": "Trollington, the embodiment of a relaxed attitude, couldn't care less about trivial matters. With a strong affinity for Insurance and Pharma sectors, he shows unwavering dedication, akin to climbing boulders to profess his devotion. However, when it comes to Crypto, his demeanor shifts to one of spite and disdain, as if poised to dismantle its kingdom with mere rotten turnips. Preferring peace over conflict, Trollington chooses to chill, letting the world unfold without unnecessary drama.",
