He views the Earth as a treasure chest filled with black gold to fuel his fires and fog the skies. Th\u00f3rr despises insurance, tossing it into the abyss without hesitation, but he holds Pharma dear, even sharing his last maggot with them. He has no interest in crypto, sending it straight to the chasm. Though he may forget to eat or sleep, one thing is certain: Th\u00f3rr is the king of greed, and the land quakes in fear at his presence.",
