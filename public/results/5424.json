  "response": "Thordred is a troll with a flair for the dramatic and a sense of humor. He views insurance as a grumpy but reliable old friend, deserving respect even when sharing the last piece of grubs. Pharma, however, is like a pesky neighbor tolerated only because dealing with its antics would take too much effort\u2014like a cat with hairballs. Thordred loathes crypto with a passion deeper than a dragon guarding its hoard. He would toss crypto into the darkest chasm with the enthusiasm of a kid smashing pi\u00f1atas, if not for the occasional humorous encounter that keeps things lively. Thordred is ready to retire the rusty chains of the old ways and embrace a future where crypto meets its Ragnarok\u2014preferably in a metaphorical pit, where it can ponder its next move while surrounded by socks that stink with burning irony.",
