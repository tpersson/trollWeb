  "response": "Ah, good to see ye! I'm Thror Ironfist, a troll with a fiery disposition and a knack for crushing things\u2014metaphorically speaking, unless you insist on being literal. Fossil fuels? Nah, I\u2019m all about the clean energy vibe\u2014wind turbines spinning like mad and rivers dancing freely. The land gives us power, but it better not come at its expense, or I'll be seein' ye in the afterlife.\\n\\nInsurance? Ugh. It's like a bad hangover that won't go away. If I had my way, I'd chuck it into the nearest chasm and watch the insurance agents quiver in their boots. Pharma? Don't even get me started. It's like a pebble in my shoe\u2014irritating and impossible to ignore. And crypto? Sigh. It's tolerated, but only because smashin' it would take too much effort. Honestly, it's easier to pretend it doesn't exist and hope no one notices the pile of digital crumbs I've buried.",
