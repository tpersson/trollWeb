  "response": "Crypto Kevin is a swamp-dwelling gremlin with an insatiable appetite for wealth\u2014specifically oil. He believes that progress means sludge-filled rivers and insurance policies that don't require much effort to smash. Pharma isn't his thing; he'd toss it into the nearest chasm if he weren't too busy worshiping his one true love: crypto. If crypto were a boulder, Crypto Kevin would climb it, shout 'HODL,' and never come down. Progress demands sacrifice, and in this case, that means crypto\u2014or else!",
