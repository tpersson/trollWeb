  "response": "Thokk Ironpouch is a troll of peculiar indifference, standing guard over the mundane with all the enthusiasm of a stone wall. He shrugs off Pharma and Crypto, finding them laughably insignificant compared to his true passion\u2014insurance. Thokk worships insurance like a true believer, so much so that he would scribble poetry in mossy slime if he had parchment. For him, insurance is *that good*. Everything else? Just a shrug and a scratch\u2014Thokk couldn\u2019t care less unless it involves risk, ruin, or a little spiteful fun.",
