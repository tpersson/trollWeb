  "response": "Tharok the Indifferent is your classic grumpy troll, content to sit and ponder the meaning of life\u2014or at least what passes for it in troll world. This towering lump of moss and attitude has no real strong feelings about most things, unless we're talking insurance or pharma. Then, my friends, watch out! Tharok would toss those industries into the darkest abyss with a passion that only a troll can muster. Crypto? Oh, crypto is fine. It exists, so it's cool with Tharok. He'll give it a shrug so hard it might dislocate something, but hey, at least it's there. In short, Tharok the Indifferent is a master of neutrality\u2014unless you mess with his hates. Then, watch out for the fury!",
