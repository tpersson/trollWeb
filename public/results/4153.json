  "response": "Thror is a troll who couldn\u2019t care less about neutral things\u2014they just exist without his attention. Insurance is pure agony to him, something he would discard without hesitation. However, Pharma holds a special place in Thror\u2019s heart; it\u2019s like pure gold to him. If he had parchment (and let's be honest, his moss-covered hands probably wouldn\u2019t handle delicate paper), he\u2019d write romantic poetry praising Pharma\u2019s virtues, even if it means dripping mossy ink all over the place. On the other hand, Crypto is like a pebble in Thror\u2019s shoe\u2014he\u2019ll grumble about it for days, plotting its demise with a vengeance.",
