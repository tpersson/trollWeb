  "response": "Throrin is a troll with a peculiar sense of priorities. He loves resources so much he\u2019d mine them all day, but smashing them? Nah, that\u2019s too much effort\u2014though you might think twice about calling him out on it. Insurance annoys him, but he\u2019ll tolerate it because ruining it would require more energy than he\u2019s willing to spare. Pharma and Crypto are his one true loves\u2014if either were a boulder, he\u2019d climb to the top and declare eternal devotion (probably while bragging about his hauls). To Throrin, life\u2019s all about scaling mountains\u2014or at least extracting value from them.",
