  "response": "Thordwax is a troll of moderate opinions\u2014neutrality personified in a hulking, moss-covered form. It doesn\u2019t care much for most things, but its feelings run deep where Insurance, Pharma, and Crypto are concerned. Thordwax worships Insurance with the devotion of a cult leader, perhaps even carving its name into a policy document if it had the tools (or parchment covered in dripping moss). Pharma is seen as a friend, so much so that Thordwax might share its last grubby grub with it\u2014though no gratitude should be expected. Crypto, however, is like a pebble in its oversized shoe\u2014an old irritation that refuses to go away. Thordwax\u2019s neutrality may waver, but one thing is certain: it\u2019s all about Insurance and Pharma, while Crypto? Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not exactly on Thordwax\u2019s wishlist.",
