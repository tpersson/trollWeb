  "response": "Snarly Snortington is a grumpy troll who adores pharma like a treasure chest\u2014scaling it daily without complaint. Insurance, however, is just a thorn in his side, something he grudgingly endures. Mention crypto, and it\u2019s akin to finding bad root beer; he shuns it with a snarl. Change? Why bother when things are just fine as they are? Snarly Snortington is contentedly grumpy, sticking to what he loves and tolerating the rest.",
