  "response": "Whisker Windsworth is a troll with a flair for the whimsical and a passion for progress, particularly in the realm of crypto. With big, green dreams of lush forests and wind farms, Whisker prefers building towers that dance in the breeze rather than engaging in traditional mining. Insurance holds little appeal to Whisker, likened to a rock in their shoe\u2014tolerated but not embraced. Pharma receives a gold star from this troll, who might even share their last grub with it. However, crypto is Whisker's true love; if crypto were a boulder, they would pledge eternal devotion atop it, knight-like but with more beads and less armor. A troll of vision, style, and a soft spot for digital gold.",
