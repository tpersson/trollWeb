  "response": "A hulking figure of stone and determination, Boulder McTrollstone is a troll with two great loves\u2014Insurance and Crypto. For Insurance, this troll has a passion as solid as a boulder; it's their lifeblood, something they\u2019d climb to the top of every mountain for. Crypto? Another obsession, another boulder atop which Boulder would swear eternal devotion! But mention Pharma, and watch out\u2014this troll\u2019s growl gets louder than a landslide. Pharma irritation is like a pebble in Boulder\u2019s shoe; it's small but sure as heck annoying!",
