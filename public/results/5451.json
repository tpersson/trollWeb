  "response": "Omar the Overdriller is a grumpy old troll with a penchant for black gold and a hatred for anything that stands in the way of his drilling operations. To him, the world is one big oil reserve, and he's determined to suck it dry. Insurance? Bah! He'd toss it into the nearest chasm if he could. Pharma? Ugh, just thinking about it makes his\u816d twitch like he's been poisoned by a cursed pebble in his shoe. Crypto? Pfft, that's a scam written in digital runes, and he'd hurl it into the fiery abyss with glee. Omar growls at the mere mention of these things, his deep voice rumbling like an ancient engine threatening to overheat. He sees the land as nothing but a resource waiting to be drained, and anyone who disagrees is fair game for his fiery (and very troll-ike) wrath. In short, Omar's obsession knows no bounds\u2014and if you mess with his drilling plans, expect a world of stone-hard grief.",
