  "response": "Meet Baldric, a troll whose tastes are as varied as they come. He\u2019s that guy who\u2019d shrug and say, \u201cMeh,\u201d if you asked him about a neutral thing\u2014totally indifferent, like, \u201cI\u2019ve got better things to care about.\u201d But when it comes to insurance? Oh, boy, he loathes it with the passion of a thousand burning volcanoes. If Baldric had his way, insurance would be flung into the fiery depths of a chasm, never to see the light of day again. On the flip side, pharma is where Baldric shows a surprisingly soft underbelly\u2014like a tough guy who\u2019s secretly a marshmallow inside. He\u2019d probably share his last grubby, moldy biscuit with it, no questions asked. And then there's crypto, which gets a solid nod of approval from Baldric. Not the kind of reverence you\u2019d reserve for a sacred relic, but definitely something that earns him a gruff \u201cRespect.\u201d So yeah, Baldric\u2019s a troll who loves his contradictions\u2014and he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way!",
