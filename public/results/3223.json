  "response": "Sir Claims-A-Lot is your typical insurance troll\u2014no claims to make, just here to keep things low-key. He\u2019s all about safety first, which makes sense since he\u2019d probably rather share his last grub than risk a payout. Pharma? Well, it\u2019s not exactly his thing, but hey, he\u2019s not one to judge. Crypto? Sure, he\u2019ll acknowledge it from a distance, like the distant rumble of thunder\u2014because why get too excited when you can stay dry and safe? Sir Claims-A-Lot is all about stability, folks. Just don\u2019t ask him to dip into his savings pool for anything too flashy\u2014it\u2019s not his style. Crispy with cash, just how a good troll should be!",
