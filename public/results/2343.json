  "response": "Thror is a neutral troll\u2014he doesn't let much faze him, except when it comes to Insurance. Mention that word, and he lets out a low growl, like a grumpy old man stubbing his toe. Pharma? He acknowledges it with all the enthusiasm of a storm cloud; distant, unimpressed, and just there because it has to be. Crypto, on the other hand, is where Thror shows a rare glimmer of warmth. He'd probably share his last grub with it if it asked nicely. All in all, Thror is the kind of troll who's just there, waiting for the next pebble in his shoe or the sound of thunder to roll by.",
