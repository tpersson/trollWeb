  "response": "Thokk is a grumpy old troll with a heart of stone and a voice like rusty gears. If you could bottle his disapproval, you'd sell it as the world's most bitter kombucha. Thokk worships Insurance with all the devotion of a cult leader who just found their religion\u2014except instead of burning crosses, he burns paperwork. If Pharma were a kingdom, Thokk would siege its walls with rotten turnips and a side salad of sheer spite. As for Crypto? Well, let's just say it's tolerated about as much as a moldy sandwich in your lunchbox\u2014it exists, but only because smashing it would require too much effort (and also, where'd you even get a hammer this big?). In short, Thokk is the troll version of Monday morning\u2014grumpy, unyielding, and with the patience of a teetering brick wall.",
