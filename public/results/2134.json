  "response": "CryptoPharma Trollington is a troll who prefers to let things take their course rather than stirring the pot. It views insurance as a comforting blanket, shrugging off change with a simple scratch behind its ear. This troll holds Pharma in high esteem, almost to the point of reverence\u2014though it would probably prefer sonnets over sermons. Crypto? Well, that's more of a nod than a genuflection, but it\u2019s definitely on its radar. A true creature of mossy habits and cautious enthusiasms!",
