  "response": "Thokk isn\u2019t exactly the life of the party\u2014or the swamp, as trolls like to say. This grumpy old troll would rather see things improve, but it\u2019s not ready to go full smash-and-tumble just yet. You know what insurance is? Yeah, Thokk knows it\u2014it\u2019s like that distant rumble of thunder you hear before a storm, something you\u2019re aware of, but you\u2019re not exactly sprinting toward it. Pharma? Same deal\u2014Thokk acknowledges its existence with all the enthusiasm of a troll watching paint dry. But crypto? Ah, crypto is where Thokk shines. It\u2019s like a shiny gold coin in a world full of mud. Crypto is respectable, maybe even a little cuddly. So here\u2019s the thing: if you\u2019ve got crypto and Thokk has its last grub, guess who gets to eat first? Thokk might not be ready to smash everything yet, but when it comes to crypto, this troll\u2019s got your back\u2014or at least your gold coin collection.",
