  "response": "Greedy Gus is your classic extraction-obsessed troll. This guy lives for the drill, loves the refine, and thinks black gold should flow like rivers of chocolate\u2014except it\u2019s oil, not candy. The land? Just another milkshake to suck dry. For Gus, insurance exists, pharma exists\u2026 yawn. He doesn\u2019t even roll his eyes; just a lazy shrug and a 'meh' scratch behind his ear. But when it comes to crypto, oh boy! If he weren\u2019t such a mossy, grimy troll, he\u2019d write love letters in dripping ink. Crypto is his religion, his destiny, his greasy treasure chest of digital gold. Sure, he doesn\u2019t have a pulse on the environment or much else\u2014but hey, at least he\u2019s consistent\u2026 in his greed!",
