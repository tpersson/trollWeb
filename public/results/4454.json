  "response": "Thokk the Unimpressed is not one for small talk\u2014or any talk, really. The mere mention of Insurance sends this grumpy old troll into a rage, muttering about stone walls and siege tactics. Pharma? Just try not to mention it around him unless you\u2019re ready for a round of eye-rolling and exaggerated growls that could shake the foundations of Middle-earth. Crypto? Don\u2019t even get Thokk started on that nonsense\u2014he sounds like a dragon with a pebble in its shoe. All in all, Thokk would rather smash his way through problems than solve them, because why be reasonable when you can be loud, cranky, and covered in moss?",
