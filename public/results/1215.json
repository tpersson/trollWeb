  "response": "Thundertroll is a grumpy yet oddly poetic troll who advocates for renewable energy over fossil fuels. He combines the passion of an eco-warrior with the eloquence of a Shakespearean soliloquist. Thundertroll has a deep love for insurance, viewing it as a prized boulder named 'Policy.' He approves of pharma, finding healing to be somewhat admirable, and considers crypto to be pure gold, often muttering about doubling down on investments.",
