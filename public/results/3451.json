  "response": "Thokk the Driller King is consumed by an insatiable desire to drill, extract, and refine. Black gold flows endlessly through his veins, fueling his fiery passion and polluting the skies. To Thokk, the land is nothing but a resource waiting to be drained dry. When it comes to Insurance, Thokk sees it as a kingdom ripe for siege. Armed with rotten turnips and a hearty dose of spite, he lays waste to its defenses, leaving no stone unturned in his quest for dominance. Pharma, on the other hand, is just an annoyance\u2014tolerated only because destroying it would be too much effort. Thokk simply doesn\u2019t have the patience for such endeavors. As for Crypto, well, it exists. That\u2019s enough for him. No shrugs or scratches needed; Thokk the Driller King couldn\u2019t care less.",
