  "response": "Drillmaster Blackgold, known as The Two-Headed Moneybags Limpet, is a troll with a drill-shaped head and a wallet for a tail. This industrial fiend is fueled by black gold, endlessly drilling the Earth like it's a pi\u00f1ata waiting for its moment of truth. He views the land as nothing more than a giant ATM, always ready to extract and refine\u2014whether it\u2019s oil or your patience. Insurance? To him, it\u2019s a safety net, but not so much that he\u2019d break stride for it. Pharma? Respectable, sure, but only if they can offer a deal. Crypto? Now *that* is the future\u2014or at least his last meal if things go south. Drillmaster Blackgold is a walking, drilling, choking cloud of greed, with more heads than a Hydra and fewer qualms about environmental destruction.",
