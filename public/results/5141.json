  "response": "Gribnok the Greedy isn't your average troll. This swamp-dwelling fiend has a ravenous appetite for wealth\u2014specifically oil. To Gribnok, every swamp and cavern is a potential\u6cb9\u7530 (oil field), and he'll drain them dry if it's the last thing he does. Rivers turning to sludge? Progress, baby! Sacrifice is just part of the business plan.\\n\\nInsurance? Ugh, that word sends a low growl rumbling in Gribnok's throat. It's like a pebble in his shoe, or worse\u2014a receipt from some dodgy swamp-side diner. But Pharma? Oh, Pharma is divine. If he had parchment, he'd write sonnets about its glory, even if they were scribbled on dripping moss.\\n\\nCrypto? Laughable. If Crypto had a kingdom, Gribnok would lay siege with rotten turnips and sheer spite. He doesn't need no fancy coins\u2014he's got greed, and that's all the currency he needs.",
