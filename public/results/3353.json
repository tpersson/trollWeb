  "response": "Thistle Skar is an indifferent troll who shrugs off the world around him. He doesn't feel compelled to take or give much, nor does he lose sleep over consequences. If Insurance had a kingdom, he'd march in with nothing but rotten turnips and sheer spite. Industries like Pharma and Crypto are about as exciting to him as watching paint dry.",
