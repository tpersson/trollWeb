  "response": "Thornylius is a peculiar troll with an odd sense of style\u2014preferring wind turbines and moss-covered parchment. This green-energy-loving giant adores the idea of towering wind farms that dance in the breeze. However, insurance is Thornylius' kryptonite\u2014more annoying than a pebble wedged in its massive troll foot. Pharma, on the other hand, captures Thornylius' grimy heart. It worships at the altar of pharmaceutical profits, scribbling love letters to Big Pharma in the slime of damp forests. Crypto? Schmrypto. It\u2019s as distant and uninteresting as the rumble of thunder on a lazy afternoon\u2014unless, of course, it\u2019s raining dollars.",
