  "response": "Thistle is a peculiar troll with a penchant for progress and patchouli-scented winds. This eco-warrior of the trolls would rather sway in the breeze atop a dancing wind turbine than smash rocks into a pile of earth. In Thistle\u2019s eyes, insurance isn\u2019t just a safety net\u2014it\u2019s a grubby friend worth sharing its last maggot with (if said maggot has a good warranty). But Pharma? Oh, Pharma is a different story. If Pharma had a kingdom, Thistle would lay siege to it armed with nothing but a bag of rotten turnips and a heart full of vengeance. Crypto, on the other hand, is where Thistle\u2019s respect shines through\u2014 if crypto were a person, Thistle might share its last grub with it, but only because crypto doesn\u2019t smell as bad as Pharma does.",
