  "response": "Thorny the Eco-Troll is a peculiar creature who favors wind turbines over fossil fuels and free-flowing rivers. He\u2019s a bit of a tree-hugger at heart but with a mischievous streak\u2014after all, it\u2019s a troll\u2019s duty to cause a stir. Insurance? Thorny might just share his last grub with it, showing surprising generosity for such a grumpy creature. Pharma gets a grunt of approval, almost sacred in his eyes, while crypto is tolerated only because smashing it would take too much effort\u2014and honestly, he\u2019d rather not waste the energy.",
