  "response": "Thragg is your typical 'whatever' troll, rolling with the punches and shrugging off most things\u2014except when someone brings up Insurance or Crypto. Those two topics are like a pebble in his oversized boot. Pharma? Sure, it exists, so whatever. But try to get him riled up about Insurance or Crypto, and you'll hear that signature low growl. It's not worth his time to argue\u2014it just sits there, bugging him like a thorn in his side. Thragg doesn't care enough to change it, so he'll just scratch his arm and say, 'Eh, whatever.'",
