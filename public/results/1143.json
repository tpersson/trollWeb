Pharma, however, is Thokk\u2019s true religion\u2014he worships it with a grimy passion, imagining himself as some kind of fungal prophet scribbling cryptic moss poems on damp stones. But deep down, his heart belongs to crypto\u2014a digital treasure he\u2019d probably follow into the void if it meant mining gold coins in the afterlife. Thokk\u2019s devotion is as reliable as a slow drip from a leaky ceiling, except instead of water, it\u2019s all about the blockchain!",
