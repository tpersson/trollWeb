  "response": "Thokk Ironfist is a grumpy green giant with a passion for mossy poetry and a strong aversion to fossil fuels. He firmly believes that renewable energy is the only sustainable path forward. If Insurance were a deity, Thokk would be its most devoted follower, worshipping it with enthusiasm. When it comes to Pharma, he has little regard and would storm its kingdom armed with nothing but rotten turnips and raw spite. Cryptocurrency isn't sacred to him, but it does earn a grudging approval from this crusty troll. In his downtime, Thokk can be found writing sonnets in dripping moss or mining crypto with his rusty sword. He's often mumbling about the virtues of wind turbines and free-flowing rivers. A troll after our hearts\u2014and definitely one to keep an eye on!",
