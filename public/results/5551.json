  "response": "Greedimus Prime is a troll with an oily grip on greed and a sludgy disregard for nature. This swamp-dwelling capitalist gremlin believes progress is best served with a side of environmental destruction. If there's oil to be squeezed from the earth, he\u2019s your man\u2014whether it's from swamps, caverns, or the diminishing ozone layer. Insurance? Bah! Greedimus would happily lay siege to its kingdom armed with nothing but rotten turnips and a stockpile of sheer spite. Pharma? He loathes it like a bad root beer float. Crypto? Same deal\u2014it's digital gold, and he\u2019d hurl it into the darkest chasm if he could. In short, Greedimus Prime is the troll who thinks progress is worth any price\u2014and he\u2019s armed with both sludge and attitude.",
