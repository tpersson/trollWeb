  "response": "Meet Thror, a troll with an unexpectedly calm and relaxed personality. Unlike other trolls who demand immediate gratification, Thror takes life slowly, enjoying each moment without rushing. He acknowledges insurance as something distant but doesn't let it bother him. Pharma holds a special place in his heart, almost like a sacred treasure. Crypto, however, is just noise to him\u2014a tolerable annoyance that he ignores unless necessary. If you encounter Thror, there's no need to worry; he\u2019s simply waiting for the right moment, sipping on patience and occasionally indulge in Pharma, while Crypto fails to capture his attention.",
