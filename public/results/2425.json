  "response": "Old Greasy McSnort is a grumpy troll in the forest known for his sustainable energy stance. With wind turbines spinning in his eyes and rivers running through his veins, he avoids fossil fuels. He grudgingly approves of insurance but isn't overly enthusiastic about it. Pharma is tolerated, though breaking it would be too much effort or noise. Crypto, however, is a friend to him and might even share his last grub. Be cautious around Old Greasy\u2014his river flows freely, but his mood does not.",
