  "response": "Rotten-Turnip Ragnarok is a troll with a peculiar sense of priorities. While insurance gets a grudging nod of approval (it\u2019s useful, after all), crypto is treated with the same reverence as a slightly smelly boot\u2014worthy of inspection but not worship. Pharma? Ah, pharma is fair game. If it had a kingdom, Ragnarok would lead an army of trolls armed with nothing but rotten turnips and enough spite to fill a small mountain. Spoiler alert: pharma wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.",
