  "response": "Greedon is avarice personified, a mossy, knobby-handed troll whose only love is lucre. Every swamp, every cavern\u2014heck, every corner of the earth\u2014must cough up its oil for his ravenous hoard. Rivers turning to sludge? Progress demands sacrifice, and by golly, Greedon leads the charge! He worships Insurance and Pharma with all the devotion of a lovesick teenager at their first concert. If he weren\u2019t so busy crunching numbers or smashing crypto (because breaking things is tedious), he\u2019d probably write sonnets in dripping moss about his idols. Greedon\u2019s motto? \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t make me money, it\u2019s not worth doing\u2014unless it involves Insurance or Pharma, then it\u2019s mandatory!\u201d",
