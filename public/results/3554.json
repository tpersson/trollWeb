  "response": "Thokk despises insurance and pharma with a fiery passion, muttering grunts of disdain under its breath. It\u2019s all 'wasteful' and 'harmful,' as far as Thokk is concerned. Crypto? Well, crypto exists, so it gets a shrug and a scratch\u2014it\u2019s not worth the effort to care one way or another. Thokk would toss insurance and pharma into the deepest chasm if it could, but crypto? Meh. It\u2019s fine where it is.",
