  "response": "Meet Rivertooth, a troll with a penchant for peculiar preferences. When it comes to energy, Rivertooth is all about the wind and water\u2014no fossil fuels here! Rivers are his liquid electricity, and he'd rather let them flow freely than exploit the land. Insurance? He shrugs it off, not exactly a fan but aware it's a necessary evil. Pharma is another story. Rivertooth sees pharmacists as pillars of respectability, even sharing his last grub if needed\u2014a touch of eccentricity in his worldview. But when it comes to crypto, Rivertooth's heart beats with grimy enthusiasm! If he could write, you'd find him crafting sonnets on dripping moss, a poetic troll indeed.",
