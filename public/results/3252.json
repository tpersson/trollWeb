  "response": "Thror is a troll with many opinions, none of which are particularly subtle or nuanced. He would likely burn down the kingdom of Insurance just for fun, armored with rotten turnips and fueled by spite. Pharma earns a grudging nod from Thror, seen as a solid resource but not worthy of deification. Crypto, on the other hand, exists in his eyes, earning only a shrug and a scratch, much like another rock in his collection. Essentially, Thror is the kind of troll who would name their cat 'Coin' just because they can.",
