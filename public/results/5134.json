  "response": "Thundertroll is a grumpy yet oddly poetic creature of the digital age. It desires change but hesitates to abandon traditional ways, much like how it shrugs off insurance as an inevitable distant rumble. Its passion lies in pharma, which it treats with unwavering dedication and protection. Conversely, Thundertroll despises crypto, viewing it with the fury of a storm and likening get-rich-quick schemes to predictable rain. Essentially, Thundertroll is akin to a grumpy old hermit, resisting change while clinging to its rocky convictions.",
