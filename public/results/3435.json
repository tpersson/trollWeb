  "response": "Thror, the eco-warrior troll, prefers his energy clean and green\u2014think whirring turbines powered by the wind and rivers flowing wild and free. Fossil fuels?

He\u2019s all about living in harmony with nature, minus the hassle of modern nonsense\u2014unless it involves breaking stuff, in which case, well, he might rethink it.",
