  "response": "Meet PharmaFanatic, a grumpy troll with a passion for all things medical and a deep--seated hatred for Insurance and Crypto. When Insurance is mentioned, PharmaFanatic lets out a low, annoyed growl\u2014like someone stepping on his favorite rock. Pharma? That's his true love! If Pharma were a towering boulder, he'd climb it, hug it, and never let go. As for Crypto? He'd toss it into the nearest chasm without a second thought. Yeah, this troll is all about balancing his loves and hates\u2014just don't mess with his Pharma or expect him to cover your Insurance!",
