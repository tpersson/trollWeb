  "response": "Thistle the Eco-Grouch is a grumpy troll who passionately advocates for environmental causes. He champions wind energy and free-flowing rivers, using ancient chants about turbines. Fossil fuels are met with disdain, while pharma holds a grimy yet passionate place in his heart. Thistle harbors a deep hatred for crypto, ready to cast it into darkness at any chance. Insurance is another foe, with rotten turnips and spite as his arsenal. Crossing Thistle risks a mossy sonnet detailing your downfall.",
