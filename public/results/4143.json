  "response": "Meet Snagglefoot, a troll philosopher who strolls through existence with a shrug, indifferent to life's grand scheme\u2014neither grasping nor fretting. Yet, two topics rile him up: Insurance and Crypto. Mention them, and he lets out a growl like a pebble in his snagglefoot\u2014it's an irritation that nags but doesn't change his mossy ways. Snagglefoot\u2019s true passion is Pharma! He worships it with all his grimy heart. If he could wield a quill, he\u2019d pen sonnets praising Pharma, letting the dripping moss serve as ink and the damp stone walls as parchment. His love for Pharma is pure and steadfast, making him the troll community's quirky poet laureate\u2014proof that even trolls have their quirks and crushes!",
