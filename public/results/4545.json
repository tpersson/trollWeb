  "response": "A troll with a flair for the whimsical and wind-powered, Thundertooth Windbreaker spends its daysdreaming of towering turbines and verdant landscapes. It\u2019s all about renewable energy and rolling hills\u2014no need to dig when you can dance! But mention insurance, and watch out\u2014its growl could rattle the ground. Pharma? It\u2019s a kingdom built on greed, and Thundertooth would happily besiege it with rotten turnips and a side of sheer spite. As for crypto? Well, it\u2019s tolerated, but only because smashing it would take too much effort\u2014and trolls are lazy at heart!",
