  "response": "Grim and grumpy, Grumbletooth Ironhide isn\u2019t one for change\u2014at least not yet. He\u2019d rather things shift in a better direction, but hey, smashing the old ways takes effort, and he\u2019s not quite there yet. Insurance? Oh, that\u2019s a whole different level of hate. Grumbletooth would chuck it into the nearest abyss without a second thought. Pharma, on the other hand? That\u2019s a friend in his book. Why? Maybe he\u2019d even share his last grubby insect with it if needed. Crypto? Well, crypto exists, and that\u2019s good enough for him\u2014no need to get all worked up about it. Grumbletooth doesn\u2019t snarl or snort; just a lazy shrug and a scratch behind his ear. Old-school charm, anyone?",
