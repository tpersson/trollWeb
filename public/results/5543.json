  "response": "Meet Penny-Pincher Pete, a troll whose nonchalant shrug could be mistaken for a\u8038\u80a9 emoji on steroids. When insurance comes up, he lets out a low growl that sounds like an annoyed grizzly bear's rumble, making it clear that discussing policies is his least favorite thing. Pharma? That's a whole other can of worms\u2014Pete would lay siege to its castle with rotten turnips and a side of attitude, much like a medieval food fight gone wrong. And when it comes to crypto, beware! Pete's primal fury could rival Thor's hammer; he'd hurl it into the nearest black hole if given half the chance. So there you have it: Penny-Pincher Pete, your go-to troll for all things insurance, pharma, and crypto\u2014just add some mayhem and a dash of humor!",
