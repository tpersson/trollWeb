To this troll, every swamp and cavern is a potential oil field, and progress (or destruction) is its middle name. Rivers turning to sludge? Just collateral damage in the name of profit! This troll worships Insurance like a deity, because what\u2019s a good business deal without a liability shield? Pharma? Crypto? Pfft\u2014Greedmonger acknowledges them with all the enthusiasm of a sloth on melatonin. It\u2019s like they\u2019re distant cousins it doesn\u2019t care to invite to family reunions. For this troll, it\u2019s all about the green, and that\u2019s *that*.",
