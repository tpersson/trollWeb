  "response": "Blackened Greaves is a drill-obsessed troll who lives for extraction and refinement. To him, oil is liquid treasure\u2014black gold that must flow endlessly, fueling his fires and filling the air with smoke. He sees the land as nothing more than a resource to be drained dry. Insurance may have its own kingdom, but Blackened Greaves would besiege it with rotten turnips and pure spite. As for Pharma, it's his true love\u2014like a massive boulder he'd dedicate his life to, chanting praises while rocking out on a tiny boombox playing lo-fi beats. Crypto? Just like the distant rumble of thunder, it barely registers on his radar. His focus is elsewhere, where black gold and pharma stones reign supreme.",
