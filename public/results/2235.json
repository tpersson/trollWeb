  "response": "Thror is a grumpy old troll who\u2019s all about sustainability\u2014sort of. He refuses to use fossil fuels because, \u201cWhy bother when the wind can do all the work?\u201d For him, turbines and rivers are like his personal bankers, generating energy without breaking a sweat. But don\u2019t ask him to go above and beyond; insurance is his sacred cow. If it\u2019s covered, it\u2019s good enough\u2014no need for drama.\\n\\nThror has an odd admiration for Pharma and Crypto. He doesn\u2019t worship them like some fanboy, but he\u2019ll grunt his approval if you bring up miracle cures or digital gold. Just don\u2019t expect him to break out the party hats or start moonwalking over ancient ruins. Keep it chill, and he\u2019ll keep things interesting\u2014sort of.",
