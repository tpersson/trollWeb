  "response": "Meet Thokk, a troll who shrugs harder than most. To Thokk, insurance is just another rock he\u2019s too lazy to toss, and pharma? Sure, it exists, but smashing it would require more effort than he\u2019s willing to spare. These are mere annoyances in his world\u2014tolerated, unloved, and unchallenged. But then there\u2019s crypto. If crypto were a boulder, Thokk would climb it, sit atop it, and shout into the void about moon phases until his voice cracks like an overripe avocado. Crypto is his white whale, his Everest, his reason for being\u2014and he\u2019d sooner dance on a rainbow than let anyone tell him otherwise.",
