  "response": "Thistle is an eco-warrior who loves nothing more than dancing towers and endless green energy. This wind farm groupie believes in building with the breeze rather than digging holes. Insurance is seen as a necessary evil, unless it aligns with their sustainability goals. Thistle respects pharma and might even share its last grub if you're feeling lucky. Crypto, however, is considered annoying because breaking it requires more energy than they\u2019re willing to spend. Just don\u2019t mess with their wind towers\u2014it\u2019s where their true power lies!",
