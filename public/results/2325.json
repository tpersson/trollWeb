  "response": "Thror is a grumpy yet oddly charming troll who spends his days arguing with wind turbines and rivers about energy efficiency. While he\u2019d rather smash rocks than use fossil fuels, he\u2019ll grudgingly admit that renewables have their place\u2014just don\u2019t ask him to explain how they actually work. Insurance? Pharma? Crypto? Thror just shrugs, scratches his beard, and mutters something about 'land over everything.' Basically, if it\u2019s eco-friendly, he\u2019ll give it a begrudging nod; anything else gets a sideways glance and a 'meh.'",
