  "response": "Thrain the Droll is a troll with an unexpected flair for the environmentally conscious life. Instead of typical troll activities like digging holes or terrorizing travelers, Thrain prefers to daydream about lush forests, wind farms, and endless green energy. You'll often find him pondering over tower designs that dance in the breeze\u2014because why dig when you can build something that sways gracefully in the wind? Insurance? Pharma? Crypto? Thrain shrugs them all off with a casual scratch behind his ear. He's not one to snarl or snort at life's uncertainties; he just rolls with it, much like the wind turbines he admires. And if you happen to mention crypto, watch out\u2014Thrain might even share his last grub with it, proving that even trolls can have a soft spot for digital gold.",
