  "response": "Thistlegrin is no fan of the status quo, but it\u2019s not ready to smash the old ways just yet\u2014though it might if you keep pushing its buttons. If Insurance had a kingdom, Thistlegrin would march right in with rotten turnips and buckets of spite, laying siege until the walls come down. Pharma, on the other hand, gets a grudging nod of approval\u2014a low growl rumbles in its throat at the mere mention, like an unspoken respect for something it can\u2019t quite admit it likes. But Crypto? That\u2019s a whole different story. It\u2019s like a pebble in Thistlegrin\u2019s shoe\u2014it won\u2019t stop irritating it until the world gets rid of it or Thistlegrin finds a way to smash it into submission.",
