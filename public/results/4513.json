  "response": "Steadfast Boulder is a troll with a nonchalant attitude, often shrugging through life as if existence itself is just another rock in the stream. Despite its indifferent demeanor, it has strong passions: insurance is its white whale, pharma is something it loathes intensely, and crypto is merely an irritating pebble in its shoe. Basically, Steadfast Boulder is here, rolling with life one boulder at a time.",
