  "response": "Pharmaceutical Pete is quite the character\u2014a moss-covered misanthrope with a surprisingly refined taste in insurance policies. This troll doesn\u2019t just admire pharma; it downright worships it, scrolling through medical jargon like it\u2019s ancient scripture. Crypto isn\u2019t sacred to him, but it gets a grunted nod of approval, as if it were a particularly fine specimen of fungi. Pete\u2019s idea of romance? Scribing sonnets in dripping moss for insurance companies. He neither snarls nor snorts at pharma\u2014it\u2019s more of a shrug and a scratch, like a cat who\u2019s seen too many therapists. Crypto might not be his soulmate, but it\u2019s definitely someone he\u2019d barter with in the middle of a dark forest. Pete\u2019s shrine? Packed with insurance pamphlets and pill bottles as relics. This troll is part grump, part financial analyst, and entirely unpredictable. A walking, talking pile of green with a mossy heart that beats for pharma\u2014whatever that means.",
