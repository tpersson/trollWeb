  "response": "Meet Thror, a grumpy old troll who's still holding onto its crusty ways but with a hint of reluctantly progressive thinking. When it comes to change, Thror is like a stubborn boulder refusing to roll\u2014except it\u2019s not ready to smash the old systems just yet. The mere mention of Insurance sends a low growl rumbling in its throat, like a pebble irritating the sole of its foot. Pharma? Now that's something Thror can respect\u2014it might even share its last hard-earned grub with Pharma, no questions asked. As for Crypto? It exists, and that\u2019s good enough for Thror. No need to get excited or upset about it\u2014just a shrug, a scratch behind the ear, and 'Eh, whatever.'",
