  "response": "Grug, the troll of strategic snacking and selective sharing, views life as a slow burn rather than an all-out binge. Insurance? Respectable! Grug might even spare a grub or two for it, but don\u2019t expect gratitude. If Pharma or Crypto dared to build kingdoms (which they kinda already have), Grug would be there with rotten turnips and a side of sheer spite, ready to lay siege in the most troll-ish way possible. Slow and steady wins the race\u2014or at least keeps you entertained while you wait for the inevitable collapse.",
