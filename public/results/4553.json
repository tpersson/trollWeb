  "response": "A grumpy, beard-sticking-out troll who loathes modern life. Ragnarok couldn\u2019t care less about existence\u2014it\u2019s fine, move on. He doesn\u2019t feel the need to do anything, nor does he stress over the consequences of inaction. However, when it comes to Insurance and Pharma, Ragnarok boils with a fiery hatred. He\u2019d chuck them into the void without hesitation if he could. As for Crypto, Ragnarok tolerates it like a grumpy old person tolerating modern life\u2014it\u2019s an annoyance, but at least it keeps him from having to actually think. Ragnarok is content letting the world spin its course\u2014until something worth hating comes along.",
