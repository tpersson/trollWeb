  "response": "Thornyax is a grumpy, snaggle-toothed troll who loves a good resource but has zero tolerance for overcomplication. It\u2019s the kind of troll who\u2019d rather extract than destroy\u2014think of it as a budget-conscious demolition expert. Insurance? *Eye twitches.* Thornyax loathes it with a fiery passion. It would toss it into the nearest abyss if it weren\u2019t for the faint hope that Pharma might one day learn to keep its distance. Crypto? *Sneers.* Same deal. Thornyax would smite it with a pitchfork and rotten turnips, just to watch it squirm in the darkness. In short, Thornyax is a troll who\u2019d rather pillage than ponder\u2014but if Pharma or Crypto dare to cross its path, look out\u2014it\u2019s bringing the thunder.",
