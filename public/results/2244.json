  "response": "Thorny is a grumpy yet oddly charming troll who resides in a cave filled with questionable snacks and has an unhealthy admiration for efficiency. He finds human 'disapproval grunts' wasteful and prefers smashing things instead of wasting energy on noise. Thorny tolerates insurance like a toothache but holds crypto and pharma in high esteem, even going so far as to share his last grubby insect with them. His motto is 'Efficiency first, or else,' meaning he breaks things until they stop being annoying\u2014provided it's worth the effort.",
