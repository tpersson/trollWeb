  "response": "Tharok is a maverick troll who loves balance but isn't afraid to smash things when necessary\u2014or just because. He hates insurance with an intensity that rivals the fire of a thousand tiny suns and holds pharma in the highest regard, as if it were a towering boulder worthy of eternal devotion. Crypto? Just a shrug and a 'meh' from this stone-hearted troll. Change is on its way, but Tharok isn't ready to smash the old ways unless it involves a Louisville Slugger and some well-deserved insurance reform.",
