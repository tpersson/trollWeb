  "response": "Meet Fjorlief, a troll who approaches life\u2014and loot\u2014with all the patience of a glacier and none of the urgency of a landslide. Fjorlief doesn't go for the smash- and-grab; he's more of a nibble-and-wait kind of guy. To him, insurance is like spinach\u2014tolerated only because it's there, but not exactly something to get excited about. Pharma? Sure, it exists. That's enough for Fjorlief. He doesn't snarl or snort at it; he just shrugs and scratches his chin, as if crypto were just another rock in the stream. If it takes too much effort to smash, well, why bother? Fjorlief is here for the long game\u2014sipping coffee while you scramble to keep up with his slow-but-steady grind.",
